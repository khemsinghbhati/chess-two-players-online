    <p style="color:yellow;font-size: xx-large;"> 1. If you are facing issues sending move/messages or connecting, that maybe be due to firewall </p>
    <p> Do following steps:</p>
    <p>
        <li>if there is option to switch networks , you can try that. It will usually fix the issue</li>
        <li>if switching networks is not an option , then go to windows firewall settings , and restore firewalls to default, next time when you connect through browser, windows firewall will ask for permission to allow connections, after you allow it'll resolve the issue</li>

        <li>if still it is not working switch the browser on your PC</li>
        <p style="color:red">
        LAST OPTION : TURN OFF THE PUBLIC FIREWALL (only choose this option if you know that the public network that you are connected to is secure and remeber to turn it back on once you have switched the network)
